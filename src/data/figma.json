In just under four years, we have delivered tangible impact for the Chicagoland region, moving from an idea to a living organization to the launchpad for bold, novel interventions that have shined a positive national spotlight on our region as a thriving, inclusive tech hub. From TechRise to Strong Start to our recent first-of-its kind H-1B visa campaign to address a national problem, we continue to position Chicago as a bold leader in supporting the underdog. \n \nThe initial period in our short history has been focused on experimentation to learn what works and why in Chicagoland in our three areas of focus: Talent, Founders, and Regional Priorities. We are now investing heavily to determine what the next five years and beyond could look like to ensure our region and residents are prepared to thrive in the rapidly transforming social, economic, environmental, and technological context in which we live. The goal is scale. We want all of our residents to have the opportunity to participate in our tech economy so that our city’s diverse communities contribute their unique perspectives, ideas, and cultures to form an even stronger region. \n",

The business-led initiative helps impacted visa holders find new job opportunities with Chicago companies before their 60-day grace period expires. Chicago is the first and only city in the U.S. to collectively band together around this issue to support and attract H-1B professionals.\n\nAt launch, 35+ employers added over 1,200 H-1B eligible jobs to our site, with more companies and jobs being added every day.

The program has been incredibly successful: the first cohort has evaluated nearly 20 projects since August 2022, one of which went on to be funded at $250K; a second cohort of fellows will start in mid 2023; and recruitment for a third cohort is currently underway."
